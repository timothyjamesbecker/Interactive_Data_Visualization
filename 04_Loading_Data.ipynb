    "There is a nice current listing in the github repository called [awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) and will detail some of our favorites from the list. The basic premise of this repository is that vairous domains can contribute a URL and we can have a nice and compact listing of public (IEfree to use) data for our visualization practice. Some other nice places to look are [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and some of the builtin data sets that are included in [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html) and [keras](https://keras.io/api/datasets/)\n",
    "\n",
    "[1000 Genomes](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data) A US/NIH funded whole genome research project that studied the genomes in 26 human populations. Currently there are over 3000 human genomes avaible (and analyzed).\n",
    "\n",
    "[ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/) The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium is an ongoing international collaboration of research groups funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The goal of ENCODE is to build a comprehensive parts list of functional elements in the human genome, including elements that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control cells and circumstances in which a gene is active.\n",

    "[GO](https://geneontology.org/docs/download-go-annotations/) The Gene Ontology (GO) is a structured, standardized representation of biological knowledge. GO describes concepts (also known as terms, or formally, classes) that are connected to each other via formally defined relations. The GO is designed to be species-agnostic to enable the annotation of gene products across the entire tree of life. The computational framework of the GO enables consistent gene annotation, comparison of functions across organisms, and integration of knowledge across diverse biological databases.\n",

    "[NIST](https://math.nist.gov/~RPozo/complex_datasets.html) In analyzing large-scale complex networks, it is important to establish a standard dataset from which algorithms and claims be compared and verified. Currently, it is often difficult to track down the original data used for computational experiments. Much of it is floating around in various formats throughout the net, imbedded in papers, and often difficult to get from the authors. Moreover, the datasets are often modified (filtered) by research groups interested in different attributes, so that even when the name and descriptions match a citation in a paper, there is no guarantee that the data is identical. \n",

    "[International Economics Data](https://cid.ucdavis.edu/) The Center for International Data was established in 1999 and is directed by Robert Feenstra. The center is housed at the Department of Economics at the University of California, Davis.

This web site describes all the data available to the public from the Center, with details for downloading or ordering.\n",

These dietary interviews and blood tests help us measure the nutritional status of U.S. adults and children.\n",

    "Loading a file into the d3.js session is done asychronously meaning that function call will not block (stop the running javascript program).  Most modern web browser have up to 30 threads avaible for downloading resources such as HTML and media files using this method. Most modern CPUs can then process those requests and render them into the page in parallel theoretically speeding up the response time from when a user navtigates to a page and when that page is fully loaded."
