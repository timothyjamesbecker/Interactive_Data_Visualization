    "\n",
    "Some types of data are inherently spatial and involve space as a primary component. As such they lend themself to visualization and work best in that context.  Some examples are geographic boundaries, roads, waterways and other such structures.  We will learn about geometric objects (points, lines and polygons) as well as the specialized version of JSON called GEOJSON that can describe these objects and the underlying tables (or ids) that are associated with them.  We will then look at using open-source map servers that provide REST services for drawing background geographic structures like state and town lines as well as roads and waterways.  We will finish our coverage by looking at a [GEOJSON](https://geojson.org/) data file from the CT that has county boundaries and then join it to a CSV table that has census records associated with it all over a [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) background that will show roads, waterways and even some building structures such as shopping, schools and hospitals.\n"

    "#### Geometry Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We have points, lines and polygons in which we can draw relationships and overlay on any mapping of space. An important consideration is how these geometruc objects are drawn as shown below. Typically drawing will have a line or path as a series of ordered spatial coordinates. The lines or paths are drawn in order.  Polygons on the other can be more complex and are typically drawn in GEOJSON (at least for outershapes) in clockwide ordering (where inner holes in the polygon are drawn clockwise).\n",

    "Lines (or paths are drawn as a series of ordered coordinates in the space). Here we can see that the lines have been drawn from left to right with increasing point numbers:\n",

    "<img src=\"figures/geometry_lines_figure.png\" alt=\"geometry lines\" width=\"800px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Polygons are more complex since the last line will connect the very first ordered point to the very last ordered point as shown below. Notice that a Polygon would be a line if the last closure line was left out.  Once polygons have been completed (byt the closer) additional holes can be carved out of the space inside (for GEOSJON those holes get drawn clockwise):\n",

Since we are now display data that is inherently spatial, we will simply use the mapping space (known as a projection) to go directly to the pixel space.

    "Latitude essentially is a circular unit in degrees that allows for +-90 degrees from the center point which is set at the [Equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator) which is also the rotational band for the spinning earth surface as shown below in the GIF. When you exceed the 90-degree North (+90) you actually go back to < 90 degrees since this is a measure from 0 as shown in the figure above.  Longitude on the other hand measures degrees from East to West using a central point called the Prime Meridian (Greenwich). Interestingly Longitude doesn't have a magnetic or naturally occurring feature, but was devised as a reference because of shipping at sea [UK and US were dominant trade partners in 1880's when this was decided](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(geography)).\n"

    "We you use the python embedded version of Leaflet here inside the jupyter notebook (python cells) to illustrate the initial ideas of Leaflet. After this brief introduction however, it will be better to make use of the [d3_leaflet_template_webapp](https://github.com/timothyjamesbecker/Interactive_Data_Visualization/tree/main/d3_leaflet_template_webapp) which is best with the webstorm IDE. The [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest/) library privides a nice mechanism for working with OpenStreetMaps and can be used along with other python data analysis tools such as pandas/geopandas, etc for more involved GIS processing.  Here in our work we will use preprocessed GIS files that will be easier to work with since GIS is typically a specialized and farily involved course on its own."

Some common examples are to look at various country, state, town or census tracks (or even smaller at block level) for relationships about those regions. We will take a CT state census data table that has population information and use it to color the spatial town boundaries, thereby making our first Choropleth. We basically need to modify the town_style section of code and use a function to change color dynamically instead of leaving it the same hex value."
